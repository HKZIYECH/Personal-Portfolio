        <p><span class="big-H">H</span>ello there, my name is Sofonias Alemayehu, I live in Addis Ababa Ethiopia. I’m currently <br>
            an 11th grader at Andinet International School, I have a huge passion for football, coding <br>
            and programming. When it comes to football, I’m a huge Chelsea F.C fan, I’ve been a fan<br>
            for over 4 years now and It has been a rollercoaster of emotions, from winning the greatest<br>
            trophy in club football to fighting relegation wasn’t a very pleasant experience  but hey we<br>
            move on.<br><br>
            
            <span class="big-B">B</span>esides football, I love coding and programming. I started learning Javascript animation in<br>
            quarantine on Khan Academy, I started learning web development in late 2021, there were<br>
            some major gaps in between the learning process due to some personal problems as well<br>
            as lack of learning material but hey, I made this website so it’s a win win situation lol.</p>
